# Sample YAML file for override presets.
# Each block corresponds to a sampler fallback override. Remove ones that you don't need.
# "force" always overrides the sampler to the specified value.
# For example, a top-p override of 1.5 with force = true will make every API request have a top_p value of 1.5

# You can use https://www.yamllint.com/ if you want to check your YAML formatting.
